## Affinity Maps

Rodighiero and others present an interesting way of looking at the relationships between people, mostly scholars in this case. They created a network of individuals and groups that they call affinity map, where each group is connected by what they call "affinities". They divide affinities into two categories, actual affinity, where two are directly connected with each other, and potential affinity, where two have the potential to connect with each other. Rodighiero and others utilizes almost scientific methods to create a map, grouped by laboratories, and into constellations.

The article definitely gives us a clarification on how we might be able to group the doctors into a map that can easily be analyzed, while being interesting to the general public. We could group the doctors by institution, medical location license, and etc. However, it seems difficult for our project to clarify between actual and potential affinities, since we don't have connections between all the doctors like how academic environment is connected by publications. Also, currently we do not have enough data to connect the doctors by many affinities, since we do not have all the documents on a database just yet. Also, our documents are heavily centered around certain individuals at the moment, and it might create heavily skewed maps, which might actually be interesting to see. 

Right now, it seems like the type of network diagram for our project will consist of a few types of affinities, such as institution, location and time period. However, in the future, I'm pretty sure that a lot more affinities, such as government, type of work, and actual communication between individuals, can be used to create a lot more comprehensive maps after all the documents are on the databases, ready to be analyzed.
