title: Experience how an specific artist draws with the help of Machine Learning

Based on Sarah's idea from last week (see her post from Feb 23) we teamed up and developed a project idea we'd like to work on for the next couple of weeks. This post aims to sum up our starting point. Feel free to provide feedback or join us :)

### The Main Idea

One of our main inspirations is [this project](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/955126796743098368) by Andy Matuschak. In his project he extends a sketching environment with realtime graphical predictions. Therfore he uses own drawings of the past in combination with a machine learning algorithm to make suggestetion how to continue the line he is currently drawing. 
The interesting thing about this is how it feels to draw with this tool. Andy describes it as it feels like the pen 'wants' to go into a specific direction or it wants to draw a specific thing.

We'd like to use this approach to enable users to experience how artists felt when they drew. Based on an archive of sketches (e.g. the work of Paul Klee in the Harvard Art Museums collection) a machine learning algorithm could be trained on how a specific artist draws. Interested users then get suggestions how the artist would probably have continued their work while drawing.

This suggestions mechanism isn't necessarily limited to simple sketches or shapes. Even suggestting colors or elements a specific artist would have used is conceivable.
