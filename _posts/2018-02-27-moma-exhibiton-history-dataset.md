## New interactive approaches for the MoMa Exhibiton History Dataset

Looking at the MoMa Exhibition History Page is super interesting because it records nearly all exhibitions happened from its foundation in 1929. What makes this archive really valuable is that there is not just a plain list of the many exhibitions. The viewer becomes also an overview of printing materials being made for a certain exhibition in which you actually can browse through like in a PDF-File. Also available are pictures from the installation views itself, as well as a introduction text of a exhibition which interests you. You can anytime jump to the artist profile, read the biography and see which works are in the MoMa collection and how many exhibitions he or she ever held in the Museum of Modern Arts. What you unfortunately don’t see is the pool of pictures of the art pieces being presented at a certain exhibition - there are not linked, although i assume it should be possible to picture this. 

What is also interesting to know is, that there were already some people who worked with those datasets and created for example a information visualization, or for us even more interesting, a whole interface. If you are interested to see with what they came up with, you might have a closer look here: 

[Medium-Post 'Here's a roundup of how people have used Moma's data so far'](https://medium.com/@foe/here-s-a-roundup-of-how-people-have-used-our-data-so-far-80862e4ce220)

[Work by Good, Form & Spectacleist](https://spelunker.moma.org/departments/)

The latter work was developed by 'Good, Form & Spectacleist'. The research/design studio was explicitly commissioned by the Museum of Modern Arts to play around with the dataset when it was just released back then. They came up with a really minimalistic approach of an interactive platform but it seems, that there are just clustering certain information and pair them with a really straight forward form of data visualization.

My overall feeling is, that we can totally break out of the conventional zone here. There has to be a new, modern, more entertaining & more accessible way to interpret those datasets which can give people out there who are really interested in art such precious information about one of our  most important artists. I am really motivated to develop new ways of interactions and define a concept for an environment which goes further then just browsing through static websites. I want to work on an environment which overall is filled with more emotion. I would be really interested in talking about what that really means. I am open to create any form of prototype/design approach, for any device or touchpoint. Concretely I could imagine to work with 1 to 3 artists and the given material and see how far we can go with that and if we can go even further.

Here are a few interesting site-facts I took out of the about-page of the exhibition history project of the MoMa:

— The exhibition history materials were compiled by a team of archivists who processed over 22,000 folders of exhibition records dating from 1929 to 1989. The Archives will process records from 1990 to 2000 over the next three years. Currently, more than 800 film series from the past decade are online, but not yet included are thousands of film series presented by MoMA’s Department of Film over its 80-year history. These records will be added in a future phase of the project, as will a history of performance art at The Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 and an exhibition history of MoMA PS1.

— The underlying data for exhibitions from 1929 to 1989 is available on GitHub, alongside data sets of artworks and artists in the collection.

— This resource was conceived as a living archive rather than a one-off publication. Some exhibition pages have the full range of available materials, while others are limited to core information. The history will be continually updated, with new and upcoming shows appearing as soon as they are added to our calendar.
