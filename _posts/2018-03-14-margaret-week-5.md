## BAM Archive
It seems to me that it would be fruitful to build out a narrative connecting the letters and articles in this archive. Although the sample data was small it was very rich and engaging following the political and social movements surrounding the doctors, university administrators, and medical hospitals/associations. It would be beneficial to compare the views of the writers and the number of POC working at the hospitals and schools they mention.  I imagine that the audience would appreciate seeing the documents connected so that they could see the progression of the development of "black hospitals" and the decline of students given the opportunity to work at the "white hospitals".  And then how the situation developed beyond that.  I imagine students using the archive to find historical figures to write papers on. I imagine family members wanting to see how they fit into the history of the institution. In this case I think the archive should allow participatory interaction with the community because the community will be able to provide a much more complete picture of the doctors, more than their times of enrollment.  

It would be useful to have a way to navigate stories and branches of stories where people react to articles and write letters to their friends. Perhaps a tree of sorts would accomplish this dispersing of media. Maps of areas and their demographics in relations to hospital availability and mortality rates would be very interesting to map over time. It would also be beneficial for historians to be able to add commentary or video about certain subjects they can expand upon in an important way.

## Participatory Heritage
I found this reading very useful when considering building an archive that is so deeply entrenched in community. It will be very important to start this project with engagment with members of the community that will want to use the archive so we can insure that the content and exploration of the archive will match their desires. Co-creation, access, and contribution all will be essential in designing an archive. If communities can be involved in meaningful ways then their needs for the archive will be met, and ultimately the resource will be used and engagment will continue beyond this project.
