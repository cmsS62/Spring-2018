## Junger Week 7

In "Mapping Affinities in Academic Organizations," Rodighiero and his collegues create an interactive online affinity map. The goal of the affinity map is to spatially represnt potential and actual relationships between researchers and labs at academic institutions in order to give researcher a better idea of their relationship to their collegues and spark new ideas for collaboration. 

At the beginning they cite early affinity maps as being too complex, and therefore causing "the disappearance of the individual." I think the authors tackled this problem in an interesting way. The multiple layers of their design allow detailed representations of the individual, without bogging down the map with too much complexity. However, this does mean that on the macro level the individual is not represented, only when you zoom in can you see individual relationships.

In making this map they had three objectives: to represent the dynamic of scholars, to accurately map that dynaic, and to validate the map with people who are represented and users. In those regards I think they succeeded. Their map does a good job of showing the complexities of scholarly relationships.

Their interviews with users were a great idea, as it helped them customize the features of the map to the users' needs, while ensuring the accuracy of the representations. I think it would be interesting to expand the usership of the map. They say that scholars are interested because they are represented themselves, making it a narcissistic enjoyment; however, I think many others, as they mention themselves, would be interested in this kind of representation.

For example, this could be very helpful to journalists trying to find experts or get an overview of an academic field. I think limiting their usership to scholars limits the usability, at least for now.
