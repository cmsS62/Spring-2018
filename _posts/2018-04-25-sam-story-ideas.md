## Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks

Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks, or referred to as Negro Elks' Lodge (bam003_001_004) is the largest and one of the oldest black fraternities present. I.B.P.O made its name known in the community, donating money to places like Presbyterian Hospital in NY (bam003_001_004) and talking with people like Dr. Montague Cobb (bam002_003_004) to get a better sense of the position of blacks in the society. More documents regarding this group are expected.

## Churches

Churches had a significant impact on formation of black communities. Several of the influential black personalities such as Dorothy Brown (BAM001_001_001) and Montague Cobb (bam002_002_007, bam002_001_001) came from a presbyterian background, and churches hosted influential black persons to come and talk, like Dorothy Brown who gave talks at First United Methodist Church in Dickson (BAM001_001_002). In addition, these churches supported several hospitals that served some black populace like the Presbyterian Hospital in NY (bam003_001_004)

## Separate Hospitals

Black people were often forced to use hospitals designated for the blacks. There were people on both sides of the issue regarding segregation, evidenced by Senator Reed's introduction a bill calling for veteran's hospital designated for black people (bam003_001_010) and his opposition to the said bill, saying that it was not his choice to present the bill (bam003_001_011). Many of the black hospitals were not up to the standards, existing in dwelling or rooming house (bam003_001_016), and often criticized for their terrible conditions (bam003_001_017, bam003_001_034). The doctors for the black community were lacking as well, and more doctors were wanted by the communty (bam003_001_022) while being held at a lower reputation compared to their white counterparts(bam003_001_023). Many efforts were made to alleviate the situation, such as the 20-year campaign headed by Dr. J. A. Kenny to collect money to build new hospitals in the Harlem area (bam003_001_026, bam003_001_027).
