## Schembri - Continuing to develop a Bechdel Test for Shakespeare's plays

In last week's activity with the Folger API, I worked with Ashley on developing a sort of Bechdel Test for Shakespeare. In order to pass the Bechdel Test, a work must have at least two female characters, they must speak to each other, and the conversation must be about something other than a man. Last week, I pulled all of the female dialogue from Shakespeare's play with the API and analyzed it in order to figure out what percentage of the play's total dialogue was spoken by women. 

This week, I focused my attention on analyzing what female characters say in female-to-female dialogue, by plugging the text from a few scenes into the Voyant text analyzer and Jstor's Topicgraph prototype. I first picked four scenes in which females have substantial conversations with each other, which I defined as more than 20 lines of continuous back and forth dialogue without interruption from male characters. The four scenes I chose are:

1. As You Like It; Act 3, Scene 2 - Conversation between Cecilia and Rosalind
2. All's Well That Ends Well; Act 1, Scene 3 - Conversation between Countess and Helena
3. Othello; Act 4, Scene 3 - Conversation between Emilia and Desdemona 
4. Romeo and Juliet - Act 3, Scene 5 - Conversation between Juliet and Lady Capulet

Results:

From the "trends" graph, it's pretty obvious that this conversation is about a man, as its trend line is stable throughout the whole passage, while other frequently occurring words spiking up for a brief period of time as they are used repeatedly in a phrase or expression - i.e. wonderful, prithee.
