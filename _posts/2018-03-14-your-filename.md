## Week 5_ Junger Comments

Project:

I'm very excited to work on this project. I think that this is an important topic,and that it highlights an issue that is becoming increasingly visible.

My vision for the project would be to create overlapping trees. We could follow one person, with brances out into their different accomplishments and interests, and overlap those areas with other people who share those interests or accomplishments. For example, the woman whose documents we looked at last class was involved in abortion rights and severed in public office. For each of those details we could create a branch that connects others involved in the same area. I also think it would be interesting to have a timeline of the people in the achrive to show periods of interest.

Reading:
"Participatory Heritage,"discusses what aspects of different archives allow them to be participatory and what cultural concequences those aspects have. I thinkt that we should incorporate some of these features of "bazaar" archives. Specifically, I think it would be interesting to have a comment feature where people with relatives or just more information could contribute to the knowledge being displayed (this would probably require a moderator). I also think that our archive should have ways to easily share the archived materials. And maybe a way that people can currate their own collectionâ€“ not quite sure how this would work, but maybe a favorite feature or a way for individuals to catalouge what they're interested in.
