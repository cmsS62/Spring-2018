## Schembri - week 7 reading commentary

In the paper, D. Rodighiero and his co-authors discuss the possibilities of visually representing “affinities” in different organizations, focusing in their case study on the different labs at l'École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne. The authors define affinities as relative to the closeness between peers, when people they have something in common, an interest, a research discipline, a spoken language, a career, among others. They also differentiate between potential affinities (commonalities that have not resulted in a formal collaboration) and actual affinities (those that have). Further, they distinguish between affinites that have been recorded as some kind of data, and therefore exist as a digital trace, and affinities that leave unreadable, invisible, or difficult to find traces. 

In our data for the BAM project, we have a number of individuals who most definitely have commonalities in terms of their areas of study, practice, their geography, their birthplaces, their membership in organization, the conferences they attended or organized, and other potential/actual affinities. What is especially challenging our body of data is the lack of consistent digital traces available to represent and map these commonalities. 

We'll need to be mindful of presenting both the individual, the collective, and the combination thereof in our visulizations, especially since we are beginning from a place where the documents we have had time to scan contain a disproportionate amount of data about a small number of individuals.

I think the visual grammar of the authors' work in mapping their laboratories of interest is quite compact and efficient, as with each zoom in the user can move down through levels of governance and structure to see the contributions of the individuals (or even just their membership) in every lab. I think this structure also allows for the easy inclusion of members who do not have any available digital traces or data - or in our case, doctors and individuals in medicine whose data we haven't yet had time to process.

I think the authors' use of the multi-constellation model that allows the data to be mapped as a network based on different variables or data - advising/publications/keywords, etc. - is an approach that could work well with the BAM data for visualizing the many ways in which members of the community are connected. There is a large geographic component to our data, so it makes sense to have some network visualization connected to a map of the U.S. or the world, but it would perhaps enrich the experience to not have all of our constellations bound by geography, and instead have some that can sort by other affinites - like activism, keywords, or area of practice.





where relationships occur on multiple levels such as collaborations, co-authorship
of academic papers, organizational structures, etc.
