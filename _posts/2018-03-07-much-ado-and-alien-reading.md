# Voyant
The tool I used to extract information was Voyant.  The tool is very intuitive, you simply copy and paste the text you wish analyzed in the box.  After you paste your text it comes up with 5 windows of information. The first window shows a word map of the frequency of word use. This can be expanded using a scroll bar so that you can include more terms that aren't used as often.  In the second window the text is visible, and you can click on the words and see a graph of their frequency throughout the text. The graph can be manipulated to access the words by clicking on them. The third window shows the raw frequencies of words based on the document segments.  The forth window gives more general information about the text: the number of words, vocabulary density, length of sentences, and the words used most frequently. The fifth window shows the places in the context where the words appear. There a few extra tool options within the program, for example Correlations which shows words that are used frequently together.   

I inputted text from the play Much Ado About Nothing, and it gave me a fairly accurate extraction of the information from what I remember of the play. You can get a basic understanding of word choice and main characters and themes, but I wouldn't be able to say what the story was about. 

This tool made me think about a talk I attended about Humanities classes being taught with digital tools. There is a good summary of the talk here (https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/teaching-literature-through-technology-sherlock-holmes-and-digital-humanities/), but what really stayed in my head was how the word trees showed what sentences followed certain words. In the example, Joanna Swafford shows that when you input the word Holmes, there are a lot of active words that follow. In comparison, Adler is only followed by a verb once. I decided to recreate the test for fun with Hero and Claudio and realized that that approach is more useful for fiction rather than plays because characters names are usually used when others address them.
