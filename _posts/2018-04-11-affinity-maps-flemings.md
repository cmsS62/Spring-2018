## Affinity Maps

"Mapping Affinities in Academic Organizations" was written by Rodighiero and his colleges, discussing ways in which actual and potential affinities can be captured and visually represented. Actual affinities include co-authoring, co-teaching, and co-advising and show tangible ways scholars and their work is connected. Potential affinities are not "visible", so scholars could work in the same building, share a common interest, be old friends, or share a common space.  I am very interested in the potential affinities because these can be connected to the work environment of the university and social engagement, although I imagine this becomes more difficult to collect data on, even with good text mining programs. In terms of BAM I can see the potential for showing connections between doctors and mentors and doctors and schools were they studied. It might help show common patterns and social circles for doctors who worked in the same vicinity and influenced each other (and perhaps each other's careers) without necessarily publishing anything with them.
