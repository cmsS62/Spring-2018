## About the Berlinische Galerie
The [Berlinische Galerie](https://www.berlinischegalerie.de/en/home/) is one of Berlin’s youngest and most diverse museum of modern art, photography and architecture. Founded in 1975, it collects, researches and presents art made in Berlin. It exhibits painting, graphics, sculpture, installations, multimedia art, photography, architecture and artist's estates from 1870 to the present day.

There is a  permanent exhibition called “Art in Berlin 1880–1980” showing the Berlin Secession, Dada and Fluxus, Expressionism and New Objectivity, the Eastern European avant-garde of the 1920s and much more. The permanent exhibition is made available to the blind and vision impaired via tactile exhibits, a tactile floor guiding system, and a museum app to create an inclusive art experience.

Additionally, temporary exhibitions of all genres: films, concerts, lectures, readings and discussions accompany the permanent museum offer. There is also an Archive (more below), a library, study and lecture halls, a museum shop and a Café.

## The archive
The [archive of the Berlinische Galerie](http://sammlung-online.berlinischegalerie.de/eMuseumPlus?service=StartPage) differentiates itself from various other archives, because it was started by regular citizen in 1975 and has no royal roots. 

The Berlinische Galerie focuses on collecting artworks made exclusively in berlin. It consists of painting, sculpture, prints, and drawings, photographs and architecture projects in order to empower reflection and discussion on aesthetic practices. Specially interesting for Berlin and german citizen in the first place, the gallery’s audience consists of a wider interested public as well as of researchers and historians. 

Since 2004, most of the works of the archive have been digitized and made public via an online catalog. On the one side, online visitors can access a list of pictures of the artworks that are currently exhibited by clicking on the different rooms of the museum’s map. On the other side, users can search for artworks by keywords or navigate through curated groups of contents.

The contents are made available in a regular paginated list-like fashion. Specific contents can be added to a list of favourites. The items can also be sorted by name, dating and technique or material. An advanced search page allows users to filter down the displayed works by selecting a time range, a category and other simple parameters.

The archive contains a large amount of works and data. Each item is described by metadata in a very classical manner and does not provide any emotional, contextual or narrated information. Related items are missing and besides collections there is no easy way to relate different works. The website itself is pretty static and each click provokes a full page reload which makes it quite frustrating and slow to work with. The archives has no public API, which would enable more complex queries to be formulated. The image preview is quite low-res and zooming is pretty limited.

Despite the richness of the archive’s contents, the desire to explore it fades aways because of the user experience of the website and the lack of content related interaction. The valuable artworks presented in the online collection deserve a better discoverability and should be more fun.
