## MIT's CAVS Collection

These two videos feature Jeremy Grubman, Archivist at MIT's Art, Culture, Technology Program (ACT).

The first video partially captures the talk that he gave to the Digital Humanities II class on February 21, 2018 in which he introduces the digital CAVS collection, including the CMS that drives the site (sanity.io). The full video recording is one hour and twenty-two minutes but due to a micronphone failure the follwing recording ends after 32+ minutes.

In the second video, Jeremy takes us to the physical CAVS archives and talks about some of the materials that have been digitized. 9+ minutes.
