## Dianne Dietrich
I appreciate the comparison Dietrich draws between traditional digital forensics and the work done by digital archivists. According to the Society of American Archivists, archival science is a "systematic body of theory that supports the practice of appraising, acquiring, authenticating, preserving, and providing access [emphasis added] to recorded materials" (Dietrich). Part of the process that seems to me to be especially important to archivists is the authenticating, preserving, and providing access. While the other aspects are important, archivists have the tricky job of determining the integrity of digital materials. This is to ensure that materials weren't inadvertently altered, which can happen when transferring material from one system to another. The way that archivists check the digital integrity is by calculating and storing hashes of the data. However, if the hash is lost than the integrity of the material is once again in question. Another part of archiving mentioned is "preserving". This has to be done very careful to ensure the data is not altered when it is transferred. Finally "providing access" - this has its own challenges because information can be very personal and potentially dangerous to release. Archivists must redact information even as they share it.  

## Ala Rekrut 
Rekrut has a very good point in how materials exist as traces of events and actions coming from particular historical contexts, and that "Historical records are rooted in the personal and social circumstances surrounding their creation" (Rekrut). Then Rekrut goes on to talk about the information that is left out when it is digitized. The size and thickness of pages, the crinkles in pages. This reminded me of a talk that was just given at TEI about the best way of conveying information about 3D objects for learning. Ultimately users seemed to gain more information about objects that they could move around and zoom in on and see the dimensions of, even more than 3D printed models. While there is more work to be done on the study I can definitely see the benefit of incorporating more information in the materials shown in our archive.
