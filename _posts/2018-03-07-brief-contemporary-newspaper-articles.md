## Problem Statement / Research Question

Can we use archives to contextualise newspaper articles for a clear and reliable understanding of events?

In an era of ‘post-truth’, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. It is therefore important that newspaper articles are read with a more holistic understanding of correlations and connections between events and actors. This understanding could be enhanced by situating newspaper articles within a timeline of events, generated by previously published articles in the archive. Alongside, a network of cross-references to parallel events in time could be introduced.

Articles of most current major newspapers are available in text format reaching back to at least the 1990s. However, they are only accessible by means of a specific search request. Despite recommending »related articles« to readers on the homepage, they are not referenced in the archive.

## Concept

The desired result would be a functioning web application that generates timelines with cross references of events and articles within one newspaper’s archive. An article should become more comprehensible by referencing the events leading up to it and gain its readers trust by showing consistency of coverage and events. Besides the technical execution of this concept, the main focus is on the design questions which arise concerning the visualisation of correlations and connections.

## Enabling Technologies

We opt to create a web based application to enable a broad audience usage. The list of articles leading up to the selected article will, in the best case, be generated by Lucenes MoreLikeThis method. This would allow us to be independent on the language that is used.
To start the prototyping phase es quick as possible with real data we will use ElasticSearch, which uses Lucene under the hood, as a SaaS, not worrying about back-end architecture.
On the front-end we will use React for UI components and state management (Redux). Other libraries that might be of interest are D3 (data visualization) and Slate (text editing).
We will need to tweak a lot to fit our use-case, but these libraries will serve as a good foundation.

### Information Retrieval Software Libraries

**Lucene**
https://lucene.apache.org/
Seems to be the perfect candidate for our use-case. The MoreLikeThis method allows to generate a list of similar documents. It is used by wikipedia, among others and allows a big variety of data inputs (HTML, PDF, Text …). The following two libraries are based on this library.

**ElasticSearch**
https://www.elastic.co/
Is a library based on Lucene that extends the project and offers a JavaScript interface. It also has an easy to set-up SaaS. This makes it the perfect candidate since it allows us to go straight into developing and testing the frontend without worrying too much about backend technologies and performance.

**Solr**
http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
Solr is a library based on Lucene that extends the project and allows us to use its versatile HTTP and JSON APIs.

Note: Those technologies will only be used for prototyping and give a very rough/incorrect tree of linked articles. Some kind of Event Nugget Detection (Event Nugget Detection and Argument Extraction with DISCERN, Greg Dubblin et al.) will be necessary to make 
the project work in an automated manner.

### Frontend Libraries

**React**
https://reactjs.org/
React allows us to develop the project collaborative, since it is by far the most popular JavaScript frontend technology and easy to grasp for developers/designers familiar with JavaScript.
There are also a lot of resources online in form of libraries and documentation dealing with React.

**D3**
https://d3js.org/

**Slate**
http://slatejs.org/
Should we, at some point need the ability for text editing, this library fixes the browsers ‘contentEditable’ and uses React components for its rendering.

**Popmotion**
https://popmotion.io/
Animation Library for state transitions.

## Personae

The concepts target group are readers of digital newspapers, who are interested in a deeper contextual understanding of the presented information and in discovering unknown correlations between events in time.

## Field overview

[Timeline's](https://timeline.com/@Timeline_Now) claim [»Timeline puts our world in context, deepening the way we understand the news«] focuses on a similar concept, but the content is edited/curated, it is concerning single historic events and [their apps timeline](http://www.businessinsider.com/timeline-news-app-makes-it-easy-to-see-the-history-behind-a-story-2015-1?IR=T) is currently not available.
[Google’s News Timeline](https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/20/google-news-timeline-offers-a-new-way-to-search-the-past/) was launched in 2009 but has been abandoned since.
[Facebook is currently introducing](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/10/news-feed-fyi-new-test-to-provide-context-about-articles/) a button on newspaper articles which provides relevant context [»such as information from the publisher’s Wikipedia entry, trending articles or related articles about the topic, and information about how the article is being shared«].
Here are some examples of edited/curated timelines: [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/business/media/how-fake-news-spreads.html), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/national/washington-post-co-timeline/374/), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/23/edward-snowden-nsa-files-timeline), and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Trump_presidency,_2017_Q1).
