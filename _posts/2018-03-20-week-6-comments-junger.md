##Week 6 Comments

Dietrich had interesting ideas about preserving materials digitally when they're being stored for an archive. Since I don't have a very strong programming background, I didn't fully understand many of the strategies he suggested to preserve materials. But I think his assertation that records must have integrity and must be usable are pretty important and universal. His paper seems very relavent to the Warhol press release included in our readings. Purely digital materials present a unique challenge, as software advances quickly and old formats become incompatable.

I think Rekrut's article is more directly applicable to our project. She brings up many interesting points about preserving the material data of records- their thickness, their folds, their damage- and how that affects the data archive users can access. I think we should definitely keep her prompts for observations in mind when digitizing our own materials- are the materials coplete? navigable? are they arranged logically? The text that materials contain is just as important as their material qualities.
