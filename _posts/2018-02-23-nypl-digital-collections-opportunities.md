title: NYPL Digital Collections & Opportunities

This comment consists of two parts: The first part summarizes my observations on the Digital Collection of the NYPL, although I do not want to limit myself to this collection in a further approach. In the second part I will talk about the opportunities that I find particularly interesting in connection with archives.


## New York Public Library Digital Collections

The NYPL Digital Collection wants to share the diverse content of their collection. They maintain a complete collection and provide in-depth metadata. Their mission is to be a “living database” that gets constantly updated. Therefore, their intended target group is people who want to be part of this living database. Based on the variety of content and content types the audience is also diverse, so part of the target group consists certainly of experts with a passion for a specific content. 

It is easy to find subgroups and collections as well as search by word and filter in common categories. People can get metadata about content, even sometimes a visualised version of it (e.g. marker on a map). Since the collection is so diverse, one could well establish links between the contents. There is the approach to provide historical context with the so-called "Item Timeline of Events" in which one receives information about the author of the content or the digitisation period on a timeline. There are already some applications that make use of the large open digital collection: "Public Domain Remixes". For example, there is an application where you can compare historical imagery from places with current pictures from Google Street View.

However it is difficult to observe the evolution of historical events or characteristics from the materials over a timeline. There is also no function that allows you to explore content throughout the different subgroups to see connections. Switching between collections or comparing them in general is not encouraged nor highly supported.

The goal of a library, however, is not only to provide information, but also to awaken interest, to teach, and perhaps even to inspire (like the NYPL does with many different non-digital workshop offerings nowadays). Based on that, the user group of the NYPL Digital Collection can certainly be expanded.



## Opportunity Spaces

**Add Value through Showing Connections:** Hypertext is one of the best ways to explore information through content connections in the web, but on top of the fact that it is not personalized neither automatically, it is limited to text. Therefore I think recreating Hypertext for other content types would be an interesting design challenge, that also would benefit from working with a diverse collection with significant content. (The definition of connections is in this context especially interesting, because choosing the right metrics is a balancing act. Example Project that deals with this: [Yossarian Creative Search Engine](https://yossarian.co).)

**Get People Engaged** through showing them what this data means for them, is of course an obvious solution (some great examples out of many: [Population IO](http://population.io), [Moovellab: What the street!?](https://whatthestreet.moovellab.com/berlin?bike=0.33&rail=0.33&car=0.34)), but with the rise of recurrent neural networks it would be interesting to feed such a network with content of the past and make future predictions based on this content, that people could explore further. For example: What would have happened in the last election if the USA had the voting system of France? Or: Based on the collection of past city development, with the upcoming of cars workplaces and living spaces have moved further apart. How will autonomous driving change our cities now, based on what we've learned from the past? 

**Make Unique Collections:** When do we ever stop collecting? I’ve stoped making pictures during sightseeing and gallery visits, because everything is online anyway (most of the time in better quality). Therefore to depict things that haven’t been depicted before is the way to go. (Of course over time things change and it might be worth taking pictures of them again and every photographer really takes his or her personal point of view into a picture.) The idea of making our photo collection more unique is already done here: [Camera Restrica](https://philippschmitt.com/projects/camera-restricta), but how would that look like for curators, especially when the idea of a collaborative archive comes into play and everyone becomes a curator? 

These are some of my thoughts and questions I have about future archives. Whether all these questions can be answered will show, but it is certainly exciting to deal with one or the other.
