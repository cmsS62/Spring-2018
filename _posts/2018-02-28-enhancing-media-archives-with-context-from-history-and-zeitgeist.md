title: Enhancing media archives with context from history and zeitgeist

The [New York Public Library](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections) and the German [Bundesarchiv](http://www.bild.bundesarchiv.de/) consists of a lot of mixed media items which have originated across the centuries. Over the last years thousands of works were added through several digitization initiatives—[many of which are under Public Domain](https://www.nypl.org/research/collections/digital-collections/public-domain), so that everybody is allowed to download high resolution files and use them freely. The NYPL has over 700,000 items digitized by today while the digital picture library of Bundesarchiv alone holds more than 12 million images. These are living databases, so they are growing continually.

While digging through the archives and looking at the pictures I became very curious what the backstories of the works may be. All items are presented with set of metadata but there are few information about the background of a picture’s creation. The NYPL [does not provide any backstory information](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/7222294b-6ab1-6cea-e040-e00a180667f1) while the Bundesarchiv [describes the portrait situation briefly](http://www.bild.bundesarchiv.de/collections/118973760/_1519825722/?search[page]=1). Although the pictures are presented in collections, these do not have to represent a historical event or a certain topic—often they are accumulated works of a photographer or a collector. So the information about the collection often does not lead to further insights about the historical context.

Due to these limitations I expect it to be not very engaging to browse these libraries if you do not have a certain research task to complete or an other scientific approach where you deliver the background context by yourself. Though for a normal user I find the idea of an enhanced media archive very interesting.

A such archive, contending of pictures, videos, sound recordings or other media types, should handle two rough questions towards the time the piece they’re looking at was created:

1. How did people live at this time?
2. What was the zeitgeist that may have lead to the work?

Answers to these question should give a new context to the asset and let the user to experience the spirit of the time the work was created and the circumstances under that it might originated. First approaches to (automatically) shape this context could be:

- to provide census data about population and its social indicators for the location, the work was created,
- to display a timeline of historical and political events, 
- to look into what inventions were made at this time and what innovation had moved the people, 
- to add information about the concerning cultural era (music, film, fashion, etc…)
- to be continued…

In the end the archive could be a collection of narratives that arise from the combination of asset and context. In turn these narratives could be linked through their context and be curated to higher order stories. An interactive web experience could make the whole archive accessible plus giving the opportunity to participate by sharing own narratives for certain assets or for group of items.
