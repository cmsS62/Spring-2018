### Historical Newspaper Archives

The Berlin State Library is willing to share their 1.5 million historic newspaper pages of searchable full text with us. Parts of them can currently be accessed at the [The European Library](http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org). Its audience is limited to professional researchers, as the digitalised newspapers date from 1872-1949 and are only searchable by specific keywords. The »discover« section on the platform only adds filters (geography, time, language) to the search bar and thereby excludes content based discovery. 

A similar American platform is [Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov).

### Contemporary Newspaper Archives

Comparing the method above with digital newspaper archives of current German and American newspapers shows that this seems to be the general approach. Articles of most current major newspapers are available in text format reaching back to at least the mid 1990s. Still they are only accessible through a specific search request and even though »related articles« are suggested while reading latest news on the homepage, inside the archive they are never referenced. 

Reading newspaper articles often already requires a more holistic understanding of correlations and connections between events and figures. This understanding could be enhanced by showing timelines of events through older articles. With that a network of cross references to correlating events in time could be introduced simultaneously.

An article could become more comprehensible by referencing the events leading up to it and gain its readers trust by showing consistency of coverage and events. Trust could even be strengthened by connecting archives of different publishers with each other.

Based on this, one existing archive could be chosen to exemplify interfaces that promote the storyline of information and provoke their users to engage in them. A case study of a contemporary event (e.g. American/German election) could be more relatable to a greater audience. Nevertheless access to the historical archive of the Berlin State Library is already established and could as well serve the point.
