## Folger API Text Analysis

Continuing from what I talked about last week, I decided to analyze the text of sounds that were used in Shakespeare's plays. Because the amount of text in sounds section of each play was relatively small and highly variable, I scraped the sounds text from all the plays and clump it into one text file to be analyzed by Voyant and JSTOR-Lab text analyzer.

Ignoring the "sd" that is most frequent because how Folger API formatted their sounds section, the most frequent words were flourish, military, alarum, drum, music, trumpet and sounds respectively. As expected, flourishes were most frequent, followed by military. There were relatively small amount of music compared to flourish, mentioned 120 times compared to 462 times of flourish. Interesting connection that Voyant made was that flourish is more related to trumpet than drums, and military is more related to drums than trumpet, by the number of times each pair of the two terms appeared together. Overall, Voyant tools gave a nice overview on the text as a whole, using graphics that are easy to understand.
