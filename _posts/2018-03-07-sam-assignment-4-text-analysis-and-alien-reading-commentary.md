## Folger API Text Analysis

Continuing from what I talked about last week, I decided to analyze the text of sounds that were used in Shakespeare's plays. Because the amount of text in sounds section of each play was relatively small and highly variable, I scraped the sounds text from all the plays and clump it into one text file to be analyzed by Voyant and JSTOR-Lab text analyzer.

Ignoring the "sd" that is most frequent because how Folger API formatted their sounds section, the most frequent words were flourish, military, alarum, drum, music, trumpet and sounds respectively. As expected, flourishes were most frequent, followed by military. There were relatively small amount of music compared to flourish, mentioned 120 times compared to 462 times of flourish. Interesting connection that Voyant made was that flourish is more related to trumpet than drums, and military is more related to drums than trumpet, by the number of times each pair of the two terms appeared together. Overall, Voyant tools gave a nice overview on the text as a whole, using graphics that are easy to understand.

Using JSTOR-lab's text analyzer, prioritized terms were music students, drums, trumpets, followed by thunder and military music. Although drums, trumpets and military music were expected, I was surprised to see that the text analyzer extrapolated to include music students as a prioritized term. Furthermore, it seemed that the text analyzer focused on names as important terms, evidenced by the fact names of characters and places were listed as terms below, albeit not prioritized.

Although Voyant tools are quite useful (Not going to analyze what's missing from the text analyzer because there are many things missing from it), something that was missing was to edit the read text. For example, it would have been nice to have an option to somehow remove all the "sd"s from the text that were there due to formatting. Although it would not be hard to do so myself, it would have been nice for Voyant to provide tools to dynamically edit the text.
