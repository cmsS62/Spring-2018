## BAM Archive

One aspect of the archive that is reasonable to pursue would be the historical aspect of the archive, creating a timeline of various Black American doctors, which seems to be well underway already. Another aspect of the archive that is worth looking at would be how the different doctors and different groups are connected to each other. The story of Black Americans in Medicine is not a story of single persons, but story of communities. DIfferent doctors communicated with each other, were brought together by institutions they were limited to, and congregated with each other in various communities. Audiences might come and be entertained by a biographical archive of each doctor, but I think that they will also be interested by how different individuals and institutions came together to form a society that was a step away from the rest of American society. This archive could be visualized by forming a network graph centered around several tags like we have seen last week, but it also could be presented with curated sections with description of each tag (institutions, communities, etc. that each material and doctors belong in) with the material being presented visually with a picture in that section. 

## Reading Commentary

Although cathedral style archives like SULFA are not without their merits, they are somewhat they are not the best choices in keeping the community interested. Compared to bazaar style archive of Grandt's, SULFA has very few community interaction, therefore very small community interest, while Grandt's Facebook based archive is much more welcoming to various curated interactions, allowing more community interests. Although experts in maintaining catheral archives might be more knowledgeable, curators seem to allow much more community interest by encouraging their participation. 

Overall, I feel that key to engaging audiences is to keep the archive feel alive. As in the reading, archives with lower barriers to entering were able to keep the community interaction going by allowing them to participate more easily. Some other archives were able to keep active through leadership of a few people. For small archives like the ones mentioned in the reading, they will capture the interest of the audiences for a little bit, before audience feels that they have seen enough. In order for the archive to retain the attention, the archive must feel alive, telling the visitors that there are still things that they have not seen.
