## Commentary on Rekrut's, “Matters of substance: materiality and meaning in historical records and their digital images," Dietrich's “Archival science, digital forensics, and new media art” and the re-discovered Warhols 

The readings this week centered around the idea of materiality - i.e. that the physical properties of a cultural artifact have significant consequences for how the object is used. The materiality of an object can influence the ways in which archivists and media scholars create archives that host materials with integrity and host materials that are usable. 

In the Rekrut reading, the author discusses how some important aspects of an artifact's physical state can be lost in its digitization - the texture, the smell, the damages it has sustained, marginalia, corrections, etc. - and how archivists should work to understand what can be lost and include data in an attempt to remediate this loss. Examples that come to my mind are the marginalia and drawings of bored Medieval monks in recopying religious texts that have only recently received any attention. Perhaps VR/AR can help in more faithfully reconstruction an object's materiality, but it is nearly impossible to give a user a true impression of the physical attributes of a digitized artifact.

In the Dietrich reading, materiality again emerges, but this time in the context of the problem it can present archivists when certain types of data storage and data entry mechanisms (both physical and digital) become obsolete. The Warhols also tie into this - they were trapped in an inaccesible file format on floppy disks until media scholars carefully extracted them. The history of digitization often seems short, but digital computers have been around for nearly 80 years and many generations of hardware and software have risen and fallen in that span. Dietrich discusses the need for archivists to be equipped with the proper forensics tools in order to safely extract information that is unreadable with the current suite of hardware and software. Although it seems a little nuts to think about the internet as we know it falling out of style or Apple ever going under, there could be a time and place in which the archive we built in this class becomes unreadable. This actually reminds me of the [challenge a governmental program grappled with](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2014/05/14/_99_percent_invisible_by_roman_mars_designing_warning_symbols_for_the_nation.html) in designing a symbol to communicate the risks of nuclear waste that will still make sense 10,000 years in the future (when the waste is still radioactive).
