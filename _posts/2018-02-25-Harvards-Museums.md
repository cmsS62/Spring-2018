## The collection
The Harvard Museums is an Association of three Artmuseums  with a remarkable digital collection of more than 230.000 objects. The three distinct collections of the Fogg Museum (1895), the Busch-Reisinger Museum (1901). With the three distinct museum identities, the collected objects range from german expressionism, objects related to the Bauhaus, works from the Middle East, Asia and the Mediterran as well as Western paintings, prints, photographs and drawings dating from the Middle Age until present und much more. The concept provides many opportunities of collaboration to foster research and teaching to find new ways of appreciation and understanding art.

The entire digital collection is arranged in a clear and structured layout on the website and shall provide an overview. Beside several collections curated by topic, the user can interact with a well known ungenerous search interface to explore the dataset. Furthermore the interface provides extensive opportunities of filtering. Each object can be identified by three main types of classification: identificational (artist, year ...), physical (size, medium, technique ...), historical (time exhibited, centextual).

The exploration of the collection is restricted to a tile based layout with small thumbnail images and a title wich seems to be the standard solution to visualize this kind of database. This approach reduces the curiosity to explore the information space and a deeper involvement, which might lead to new discoveries.

The platform provides images of their objects in a very high resolution and a public accessible API to develop new concepts of interaction with the real content. This technical foundation might be a great start to play with new approaches of visualization towards a more playful and memorable experience of this digital collection.
