## Some Quaeries

So getting each play's "Concordance" or word count, is a nice quick way to see Zipf's law and the pareto principle in action.
Zipf's law states that, "given a table of elements where the most frequent is ranked first, the frequency of each element is inversely proportional to its rank."
This usually puts the word "The" in first place with other articles and common words trailing in afterwards. 
For example here's Hamlet's concordance: 
1030: The
900: And
726: To
661: Of
556: You
546: I
Otherwise, retroactive questions that are relevant to discovery through this API are "Who's alive and on stage? Who's on stage and /dead/ right now? Who's dead but /speaking/ right now? Answers to these tantalating, potentially ghost-busting questions can be answered by using the API to access the character charts of the play. I can see myself using this feature to remix shakespeare plays to focus specifically on dead characters and their final representations in their plays.
