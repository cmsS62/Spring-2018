Hello everyone! This is not (yet) a proper project pitch, but we (Donatus and Patrick) have been collecting some general examples and ideas for this project. We already presented this during last weeks course and now translated it so we can share here too. You can find it [here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/active-archives-research-izD2Ew5D54aBCJCq1UoZe)

In terms of actual archives that we'd like to work with we are currently considering three options:

### 1. Computerspielemuseum Berlin
A few days ago we payed the museum a visit and it is a really fun experience (pictures and videos of our visit can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/phz574ha0ccv3ud/AACWaGwc2KjohrUS7bkdIt3ta?dl=0))
With a topic like games, there are countless fun approaches for experienceing such an archive that would not be possible with other archives that deal with serious or ancient material.
The first that comes to mind would of course be some sort of gamification of the information at hand. In part they already do this at the museum with a huge wall of iconic games and a joystick that then guides a crosshair that is projected on the wall and displays information of whatever game it lands on.

### 2. US/Iran
A less approachable topic since we lack in depth knowledge, but it would be very appealing to closely collaborate with the MIT on this project. Based on the description it would be an interesting challenge to make the information both easy to find, but also fun to browse. We could imagine a storytelling approach that would clearly show how certain events are connected and what people where involved, as well as placing these events in a coherent timeline.

### 3. The Bauhaus | Harvard Art Museum
This topic also means a close collaboration with the MIT. This topic could be less difficult than US/Iran. Itâ€™s also pretty close to us through art and design in Germany. Maybe it would be interesting to visualize the exhibits through a timeline or through the connecting between the styles.
