### Story 1

Where does money travel to fund the building of hospitals? And where does it come from? // I envision this being accompanied by a visualization where you can see hospitals depicting according to size and donors depicted according to size of donation and edges connect the two whose weight reflects the size of the donation to that particular hospital.

### Story 2

As Montague Cobb traversed the winding path of life, many influences of those who supported him in his childhood were evident. Objectivity kept him clear-minded and respect kept him from lambasting the racial hierarchy that disadvantaged him. His life-long connection with one Reverand Grimke instigated his life-long involvement in the NAACP.

### Story 3
