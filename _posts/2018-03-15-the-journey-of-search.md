![We need to generate new dimensions of finding and exploring]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Artboard.png)

We want to create a better experience to find and explore content within the archive of the [Staatsbibliothek of Berlin](http://digital.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/).


### Problems

- known filter and search systems examples have often just one hierarchical depth

- often only one dimensional explorable, one category excludes others

- fix and static filters and categories

- just actual data used, no dynamic generated

- not connected search results and dumb visual lightning

- no user participation

- no reasonable search and explore journey

- no personalization or profiles

- barren and unemotional data communication

- not able to explore similar or connected elements (historically, social, political, regional, emotional, stilistic, discipline/specialisation, zeitgeist, content based,...)

- often just explicit textual search

- all in all less search and filter settings


### Concept

- automatically generated categories which getting sorted themself into multidimensional hierarchies

- localization of content, categories and fields with the data complex (personalized)

#### Enclose:

- content gets analized multidimensional to visualize more perspectives and depth

- content gets categorized multidimensional and hierarchical

- user can filter content through various, content-based and content-depending parameters and search

- new parameters get involved depending on hierarchical depth of search

- Examples for enclosing: Akinator, Chatbots,

#### Explore:

- User is able to freely navigate through the contents which are connected by similarities of different nature

- can be used to gain interest for different topics and let the mind be free in its decisions

- The data is connected like a network and prevents strict categorization and instead allows to find unseen connections and so far unknown fields

- additional explorable content

- Examples for exploring: Amazon, Pinterest, Instagram, Wikipedia, ...
