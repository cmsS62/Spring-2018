## The main idea
Dustin Kummer ([@miduku](https://github.com/miduku)) and Lucas Vogel ([@vogelino](https://github.com/vogelino)) would be really interested in using a limited amount of archive material to retrace the personal development, interests and/or relationships of one or more historical people (The subjects). The material could include letter exchanges, documents, pictures or artworks that we would relate to one another in order to portray the history of people that had an impact on history or were impacted by it.

We would like to develop an interactive web storytelling experience that would implicate the visitor in the interpretation of the personal profile of the concerned subjects. This website would lead the user through multiple perspectives/branches and push him/her to take decisions via user interactions, which would reflect different point of views of the subject’s development. Additionally, we’d like to add an individual dimension to the story; different users might choose different perspectives/branches and develop a different interpretation of the story. We’re are not yet sure how, but this is an interesting direction that we’d like to follow.

## The archive
We are still searching for the right story and haven’t decided which archive to use yet. There are several archives that collect letter exchanges. For instance, the [Erich Mendelsohn Archive](http://ema.smb.museum/en/home) collects letter exchanges between Erich and Luise Mendelsohn from 1910 to 1953 and might contain interesting stories to bring to life. Another – more sensitive – example is the collection [“A Memorial Of Paper”](https://www.its-arolsen.org/en/archives/), which collects information on the fates of victims of Nazi persecution. 

In general we believe that most Archives that include the right criteria (e.g. letter exchanges and documents concerning the subject’s personal life) could work for creating a story driven experience and we are also very open for further suggestions. We would love to speak to experts about the idea, as they might be aware of particular stories worth telling. Maybe Katrin, Frank or Kurt have some contacts or know about an interesting story that is rich enough (in term of archive content) to be told in an interactive way? Anyone wanting to join the project is of course welcome to join us or if this idea can be grafted to an existing team or project, we would love to hear about it. Let us know was do you think!
