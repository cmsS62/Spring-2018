## Reading Commentary

Rekrut's article brings up a number of good points to consider when dealing with digitized materials. Due to the nature of how materials are digitized, it is impossible to store various aspects of a material such as smell, feel, sound etc. that cannot be visually perceived. At the same time, the amount of visual information can also vary drastically depending on the protocol that the materials were digitized under, which means that three dimensional aspect, siz, and other physical qualities of the material might not stored alongside the picture of the material. Even though aspects of the material might not carry the same weight as the actual information stored by the material itself, they do contain a variety of information that can extrapolate additional details. As we go through digitization and visualization of materials for our project, we should be careful to not miss these details of the material if possible. Even though a lot of these aspects might be difficult or too expensive to correctly store, we should worry about not missing some key details of the material that can be easily remedied by simple steps on our part.

At the same time, Dietrich's article presents the fact that there are troubles when dealing with digital materials as well. Although digital materials present ease of storage and transfer, it also provides ease of change as well. These digital materials can be easily changed by each copy, since its metadata can be changed not to mention the fact that files themselves can easily be changed as well. At the same time, digital materials allow many degrees of flexibility that cannot be statically stored. The creators of the digital materials might have intended the digital materials to be viewed in a specific way that can be hard to replicate at a later date. Also, there's an issue of difference in formats over the years, and past data might be stored in a format that is hard for current technology to recognize. This is shown in CMU's press release regarding Warhol artwork from 1985, as well as how BAM biographical data was stored. When dealing with archiving digitally, we should also worry about it being accessible in the future as well as in the present.
