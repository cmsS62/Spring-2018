  This is the collaborative site for CMS.S62/S98, a Digital
  Humanities course at MIT taught by Kurt Fendt. Students will
  use this space to keep track of course resources, example
  projects, to post reading commentaries and design updates as 
  their own design projects take shape. Students from the 
  University of Applied Sciences in Potsdam, Germany (FHP) 
  will also contribute to this site.
